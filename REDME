preintall is to install pkg and configure env

install is to install vm

test is for test

all machine :root/redhat(if not,you should change)


you should use like:

this is env preparetion,you should only run once
    ./install_l1.ctl 10.73.224.191

    notice there, when install l2,we only need host ip(the sever),not l1 ip
    ./install_l2.ctl 10.73.224.191

this test case,can run many case(wait to add): 
    ./simpleTestNetworkDdReboot 10.73.224.191
